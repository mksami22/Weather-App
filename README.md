# Weather-App
## Aim:
To create an application to check various weather parameters like temprature, maximum temprature, minimum temprature, humidity, pressure, time of sunrise and sunset, etc. Instead of creating a web-app I have created a Python application using the Open Weather Map API.
## Abstract:
I have used the Open Weather Map API in order to fetch the weather information. When we run the code, a popup appears with a blank space to type in the city name. After entering the city name we get the weather information of that particular city.
##### Enter the name of the city in the given space.

##### The weather details after entering the city
